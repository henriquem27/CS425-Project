# Major League Soccer Database

Data on players, teams, goalkeepers, wages, seasons, etc. are all included in the database. It can be managed via an Interactive User Interface (UI) that can accomplish both basic CRUD operations and sophisticated OLAP procedures on the database.

Every table has its own CRUD on a designated tab, and the analytics tab may be used to carry out sophisticated SQL operations and analytics.




## Database

The database schemas are provided in `database.sql`, below is a demonstration for creating the Tables using the provided schemas.

#### Seasons Table

```http
CREATE TABLE Seasons ( Season_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, Start_date DATE, End_date DATE );
```

| Season_ID | Start_date     | End_date                |
| :-------- | :-------       | :---------------------- |
| `INT`     | `DATE`         | `DATE`                  |
