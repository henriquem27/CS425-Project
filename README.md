# Major League Soccer Database

Data on players, teams, goalkeepers, wages, seasons, etc. are all included in the database. It can be managed via an Interactive User Interface (UI) that can accomplish both basic CRUD operations and sophisticated OLAP proceduresÂ on the database.

Every table has its own CRUD on a designated tab, and the analytics tab may be used to carry out sophisticated SQL operations and analytics.




## Database
